Python - Exceptions
In Python, exceptions are a way to handle errors or exceptional situations that may occur during the execution of a program. Exceptions provide a mechanism to gracefully handle errors, recover from them, or terminate the program if necessary.

Raising Exceptions
In Python, exceptions can be raised using the raise statement. You can raise either built-in exceptions or custom exceptions. Here's an example of raising a built-in exception:

raise ValueError("Invalid input")
In this example, we raise a ValueError exception with a custom error message.

Catching Exceptions
To handle exceptions, Python provides a try/except block. The try block contains the code that may raise an exception, while the except block specifies how to handle the exception if it occurs. Here's an example:

try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    ...
except ValueError as err:
    # Handling the ValueError exception
    ...
In this example, if a ValueError exception occurs within the try block, the code inside the except block will be executed to handle the exception. The as keyword allows you to capture the exception object, which can be useful for accessing error messages or other details.

You can also catch multiple exceptions by specifying multiple except blocks or a single block with multiple exception types:

try:
    # Code that may raise exceptions
    ...
except ValueError:
    # Handling a ValueError exception
    ...
except TypeError:
    # Handling a TypeError exception
    ...
except (IOError, FileNotFoundError):
    # Handling multiple exceptions
    ...

Conclusion
Exceptions are a fundamental aspect of Python programming and play a crucial role in handling errors and exceptional situations. By understanding how to raise and catch exceptions, familiarizing yourself with common built-in exceptions, and following best practices, you can effectively handle errors in your program.
