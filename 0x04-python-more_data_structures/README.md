Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
This repository contains examples and explanations of two important data structures in Python: Set and Dictionary. Both Set and Dictionary are built-in data structures in Python that provide efficient ways to store, access, and manipulate data.

Set
A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. It is defined by enclosing elements in curly braces {} or by using the set() constructor. Some key features of sets include:

Sets do not allow duplicate elements. If an element is already present in the set, it won't be added again.
Sets are mutable, meaning you can add or remove elements.
Sets are unordered, so the elements are not stored in any specific order.
Sets support various operations like union, intersection, difference, and more.
To learn more about sets and their usage, you can refer to the following examples:

Creating a Set
Adding and Removing Elements
Set Operations
Iterating over a Set
Dictionary
A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. It is defined using curly braces {} or the dict() constructor. Some important characteristics of dictionaries include:

Dictionaries are mutable, meaning you can add, modify, or delete key-value pairs.
Keys in dictionaries are unique, and each key is associated with a value.
The values in a dictionary can be of any data type.
Dictionaries provide efficient lookup operations based on keys.
To explore dictionaries and understand their usage, you can refer to the following examples:

Conclusion
Sets and dictionaries are powerful data structures in Python that offer efficient ways to store and manipulate data. Understanding their properties and operations is essential for effective programming in Python. The examples provided in this repository should help you grasp the concepts and get started with using sets and dictionaries in your Python projects.
